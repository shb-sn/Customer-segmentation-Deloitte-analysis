# 🧮 Customer Segmentation & Telemetry Analysis – Deloitte

This project was completed as part of the **Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Job Simulation (Forage, July 2025)**. The goal was to explore how data analytics supports business decisions by using real-world retail data.

The internship involved a two-part task: First, segment customers using Excel by applying logical formulas to classify them into three business categories. Then, use Tableau to create a visual dashboard comparing key customer behaviors and metrics. The final dashboard is designed for executive stakeholders to make strategic decisions based on customer performance, purchase frequency, and potential value.

Through this experience, I developed skills in customer segmentation, data cleaning, Excel logic, and data storytelling using Tableau.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

### ✅ Task 1: Telemetry Dashboard – Tableau
Analyzed factory telemetry data from Daikibo to identify machine downtime trends across locations and device types.  
- Created a calculated field for downtime using status messages (10 mins per unhealthy status)  
- Built two bar charts: **"Downtime per Factory"** and **"Downtime per Device Type"**  
- Developed an interactive dashboard linking both charts with filter functionality  
- Identified the factory with the most downtime to support targeted process improvements

### ✅ Task 2: Equality Score Classification – Excel
Worked with employee compensation fairness data to assess diversity and inclusion metrics across factories and job roles.  
- Used Excel logic to classify Equality Score values into 3 segments:  
 `Fair (±10)`, `Unfair (<-10 and >10`, and `Highly Discriminative (<-20 and >20)`  
- Added a new column: **Equality Class**, enabling quick equity assessments across job functions
